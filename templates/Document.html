        <div class="content" id="intro">
            <p>Sales forecasting is a crucial process for businesses, especially in the retail industry, as it enables companies to make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall business planning . For Walmart, one
                of the largest retail corporations, accurately predicting future sales is essential for optimizing supply chain and customer satisfaction. This project focuses on leveraging historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores to forecast sales
                and understand the impact of major holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, and Labor Day on sales trends. By employing machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and ARIMA, this project aims
                to identify patterns in sales data and provide Walmart with valuable insights into sales performance around major holidays. The models will be integrated into a Flask application and deployed on IBM Cloud, enabling real-time sales forecasts
                and supporting Walmart in making data-driven decisions to enhance its operations and maximize profitability
            </p><br>
            <p> <b>1.1 Project Overview</b><br> The sales forecasting project using Walmart data focuses on predicting future sales and understanding the impact of major holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, and Labor Day) on store sales. It involves
                data preparation, feature engineering, and model selection using algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and ARIMA. After training and validating the models, the best-performing model will be integrated into a Flask application
                and deployed on IBM Cloud for real-time sales forecasting. The project aims to provide Walmart with insights into sales trends and recommendations to optimize sales strategies around holidays, ultimately supporting better decision-making
                and maximizing profitability.
            </p>
            <p><b>1.2 Objectives</b><br> The objective of the project is to develop a comprehensive sales analysis tool for Walmart, a leading retail corporation, leveraging machine learning techniques. By analyzing past sales data, store information, and
                promotional markdown events, the project aims to forecast future sales accurately. Specifically, the project aims to determine the impact of holidays, including Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, and Labor Day, on store sales. The ultimate
                goal is to equip Walmart with a robust forecasting model that aids in informed decision-making, enhances performance predictions, and optimizes resource allocation.
