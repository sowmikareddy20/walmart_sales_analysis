            <p>The future scope of the sales forecasting project using Walmart data includes incorporating additional data sources such as economic indicators , weather patterns, and regional events for a comprehensive understanding of sales trends. Advanced
                machine learning models like deep learning and ensemble methods can be explored to improve forecasting accuracy. Real-time data processing and forecasting will allow Walmart to quickly respond to market changes. Hyperparameter tuning and
                model optimization can further enhance accuracy and robustness. Geographical and store-level analysis can offer targeted insights for specific regions or stores. Seasonal and long-term trend analysis can guide strategic planning, while
                improved user experience and visualization will aid decision-making. Integrating the forecasting system with existing business processes such as inventory management and supply chain planning can lead to efficient operations. Additionally,
                exploring causal relationships between sales, promotions, and holidays can provide deeper insights into sales fluctuations.
